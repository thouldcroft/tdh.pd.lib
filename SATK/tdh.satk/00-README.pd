#X text 11 -116 The Sound Art Toolkit is a collection of modules that
provide fundamental \, high-level building-blocks for creating sound
within Pure Data (Pd). I have always found the workflow of coding languages
to promote unique sound productions that lent themselves towards Sound
Art (as opposed to traditional composition or production that DAWs
and even modular synthesis can sometimes direct an artist towards).
However \, even in the more user-friendly coding languages of MaxMSP
or Pd \, I have found in my own experince working with those new to
Sound Art \, the learning curve of these languages still served as
a road-block \, particularly for those without computer coding background.
The SATK is far from the first package for Pd or Max to provide high-level
modules for sound exploration \, but I believe it to be more accessible
than current packages that I have come across in my own explorations
\, and therefore I find it very well suited for those new to the field.
All of the modules have been built using only Pd-Vanilla (the core
Pd code that comes with the Pd distribution from Miller Puckette) \,
so all inlets and outlets communicate through standard Pd messaging.
This makes the toolkit easily extended with Pd code \, allowing beginners
to gradually develop Pd coding skills using the toolkit as the basis
for unique code. So while the kit is geared towards beginners \, with
the inclusion of Pd code \, I have been able to develop pieces that
are on par with works I have developed from the ground up with code.

#X text 11 93 The most straightforward way to use the SATK is to open
the file "satk-main.pd". This is a blank Pd document that you can build
your project in. The benefit of using this file is that all of the
SATK modules (and any dependency files) can all be automatically seen
by Pd \, and so no search-path configurations need to be performed.
To save your project \, perform a "Save As..." \, rename it \, and
save it in the SATK folder., f 153;
#X text 11 153 To insert a SATK module into the blank canvas \, insert
a new object using the Put menu (Put -> Object) \, and type the name
of the module (which is the same as the name of the Pd files in the
SATK folder \, without the ".pd"). So \, to insert the Audio File module
\, type in "satk.audiofile~" (without the quotes). The module names
are not case-sensitive \, but they are character sensistive \, so make
sure to include periods \, underscores \, or tildes (~) whenever a
module has those characters in their name (for those new to Max/Pd
\, the tilde indicates an audio processing module \, vs a data processing
module)., f 153;
#X text 11 232 The SATK has yet to include help files (they are on
the TO DO list) \, so as of right now \, the best explanation for modules
is the text on their interfaces \, and the comments in the code themselves.
The module list below will also provide some explanation., f 153;
#X text 11 272 If you wish to use the SATK as a set of modules that
can be called upon by Pd \, you must put the SATK folder in a place
that is included in Pd's search path. You then must use the [declare]
object with argument "-path satk" and Pd *should* see the objects inside
\, but (as outlined below) this has yet to be tested., f 153;
