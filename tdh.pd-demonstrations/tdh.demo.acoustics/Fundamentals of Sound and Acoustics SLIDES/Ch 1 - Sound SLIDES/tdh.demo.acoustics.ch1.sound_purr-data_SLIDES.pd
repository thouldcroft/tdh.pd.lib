#X text 20 160 - Sound is the movement of molecules in a medium over
time in reaction to a vibrating physical object, f 101;
#X text 20 189 - Most often these molecules are air molecules \, but
sound can travel in other mediums, f 101;
#X text 22 288 - The push on the molecules causes them to push against
the molecules next to them \, which push the molecules next to them
\, generating a moving wave that travels away from the vibrating source
, f 101;
#X text 22 333 - A sound wave is defined as a longitudinal wave because
the molecule displacement travels in the same direction as the movement
of the wave (vs a transverse wave \, like an ocean wave), f 101;
#X text 22 378 - We can perceive the sound from the vibrating source
because our ears have a membrane known as the ear drum \, which \,
when pushed upon \, creates a series of bone movements in the inner-ear
transmit vibrations to inner-ear fluid \, that then turn into electrical
impulses our brain can perceive as sound, f 101;

#X text 21 223 - The shift back and forth of the physical object pushes
on the molecules \, increasing pressure above the atomospheric pressure
\, then pulls away from the molecules \, causing a decrease in pressure
below the atmospheric pressure, f 101;

#X text 45 892 - When discussing a wave \, the increase in pressure
is known as the wave's COMPRESSION \, while the decrease in pressure
is known as the wave's RAREFACTION, f 101;
#X text 45 937 - Acousticians and sound engineers graph waves visually
as found above \, with the points above the center line representing
compressions \, the points below representing rarefactions, f 101
