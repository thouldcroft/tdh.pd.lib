#X text 19 6 Sound is something that most humans are inherently familiar
with. In fact it is one of the first senses that develops \, with the
ability to hear developing in utero. However \, how does sound actually
work? How does one person speaking travel from one point to our ears
\, and how does it get understood as sound? While this series of demonstrations
is in no way an exhaustive illustration of how sound works \, I hope
you will leave with a little bit better understanding of how it functions.

#X text 19 166 How does this all work? Let’s use a guitar string
as an example as a vibrating mass. A guitar pick pulls the string back
\, then releases it and the string starts to vibrate. The first movement
of the vibration is a movement of the string opposite to the direction
the pick pulled the string This movement pushes the air molecules around
it. Sometimes these molecules are pushed far \, sometimes pushed just
a little. Once the surrounding molecules get pushed \, a build-up of
pressure (caused by an increase in the number of molecules for the
area) results. This pressure effects all of the molecules around the
vibrating mass. As the pressure increases around the string \, the
molecules increase the pressure of the molecules surrounding them.
This pushes other molecules out away from the string. This causes a
chain reaction that produces an increase in pressure that travels all
the way to your ear drums (or to a microphone) \, with some loss of
energy. This pressure pushes your ear drum in \, directly analogous
to the string vibration. This increase in pressure on the ear drum
is known as the sound wave’s COMPRESSION. Back at the string \, the
string can only move so far in one direction \, and so it will then
swing back the other way. This leaves empty space with lower pressure
\, and all molecules attract to areas with a lower pressure \, so they
will fill in the space where the string was \, and in fact they travel
past where the space they initially had occupied. This causes an opposite
chain reaction \, where all of the molecules \, including those pushing
against your ear drum \, reverse direction to seek an area of less
pressure \, and all involved \, including the ear drum \, swing past
the place of initial rest \, and in fact build up pressure in the opposite
direction. We call this the wave’s RAREFACTION. If the string is
plucked hard enough \, the cycle repeats again as the string swings
back. This cycle of increasing and then decreasing of pressure at our
ear drum is astoundingly interpreted by our brains as sound!, f 170

splitting \, etc...), f 18;
#X text 19 76 Sound waves are created through the movement of a vibrating
mass. An object vibrates enough to make sound through an excitation
- this excitation could be air passing over vocal cords \, a plectrum
(pick) plucking a guitar string \, a stick hitting a drum head \, two
hands snapping a carrot in half \, or a rock hitting pavement. This
vibration creates a variation in the pressure of air molecules (or
water molecules \, though not as easily) that travels as a WAVE. In
physics \, a wave is an occurrance that moves energy in a space \,
and in the case of sound \, what we are moving is ACOUSTIC ENERGY.
When the waveit reaches our ears \, the brain amazingly interprets
this acoustic energy as sound!, f 170;
