#X text 28 1495 User Interface Objects Some objects are meant for you
to manipulate. These are called USER INTERFACE (UI) objects. They are
a part of the GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE \, or GUI. GUI objects can be
created by typing their name into an empty object or by using the "Put"
menu. In edit mode \, GUI objects can be edited \, but GUI objects
can only be controlled by the user when you are out of edit mode. When
you are not in edit mode \, we say the patch is LOCKED. Below are a
couple of object we will see in the next lesson:, f 194;
#X text 36 1387 Comments All of this text is created using the comment
object \, which is also inserted via the "Put" menu. Comments don't
do anything \, but they are helpful for reminding you of code you wrote
\, or to tell an outside user what is happening. Or for typing text
to explain Pd from within a Pd patch! Comments don't do anything except
display text., f 192;

message. Note how it looks different than a regular object. It still

object. Click and drag to change the number. Hold shift and drage to

#X text 581 1903 <-- This object is a button called [bang]. It sends
the message "bang" \, which some objects respond to. Other objects
output a "bang" message \, so its also useful to output to this object
to get a visual indication that your object is outputting (see [metro]
exapmle below)., f 96;
#X text 22 85 Pure Data is actually a COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
for media. It developed out of work at IRCAM in Paris by Miller Puckette
\, where it was called MAX. In the 1990's MAX was developed into a
commercial product \, so Miller Puckette decided to split off and continue
to develop MAX as a free \, open source language called PURE DATA.
It was first developed to control sound parameters of external hardware
sound generators \, but soon developed the ability to control and generate
sounds from within the environment. Pd can even generate visuals \,
play movies \, and create animations. You may be wondering why we are
using a programming language (you also might be slightly intimidated
by that term). First rest easy because Pd isn’t like a typical programming
language. Second \, the reason why we are using it is because Pd allows
you to do things that many sound software platforms don’t let you
do… and the point of sound art is to do things with sound that reach
down to the core of what sound is. FINALLY \, Pd can be run on a computer
\, on a phone \, a tablet \, or even a RaspberriPi \, which makes it
really convenient when developing a sound installation \; say you want
sounds played into a public space and you don’t want to leave your
computer out and running \, you can run your sound program off an old
phone or a RPi., f 192;
#X text 356 682 The [print] object prints any data you send to it in
the console \, known as the Pd WINDOW. This is the first window that
opens when you open Pd. You can get to it from the menu "Window > Pd
window"., f 90;
#X text 22 1025 Objects receive information at their inlets \, the
small black bars on the top of an object. Some objects have more than
one inlet. The leftmost inlet is (almost) always what we call the "hot"
inlet. Data to this inlet sets parameters and causes output. Other
inlets are cold inlets \, which don't cause output \, but do set parameters.
, f 188;
#X text 22 1124 To connect two objects \, go into edit mode \, place
the mouse over an outlet until the cursor turns into a circle. Click
and drag and what is known as a PATCH CABLE will follow the mouse.
Hold down the mouse button until you are over the inlet of another
object \, and release the mouse button. The outlet is now connected
to the inlet. The connecting cables are called patch cables because
in analog studios \, devices would be "patched" together using cables
called patch cables. This why a Pd file is actually called a PATCH
\, and where we edit Pd code is called the PATCHER. It is also common
to refer to edit mode as an UNLOCKED PATCHER \, and when not in edit
mode \, the patcher is LOCKED., f 189;
#X text 24 192 Pd As a Programming Language;
#X text 24 222 Pd as a Programming Language Pd is unlike most computer
languages \, in that it isn't purely text based. However \, Pd contains
almost all of the elements one would look for in a programming language
\; such as data storage structures \, variable \, and the ability to
develop algorithms., f 192;
#X text 24 253 To program in Pd you connect boxes \, known as objects
\, together to form an algorithm. Some objects are plain objects that
don't do much other than process information \, while other objects
allow you to click on them and interact with them (which makes Pd much
more accessible than a text based programming language)., f 192;

#X text 21 54 Introduction, f 24;
#X text 22 884 Object Communication;
#X text 26 924 Objects communicate by sending messages to each other.
To send a message \, an object must output a message from its outlet
\, which is the small black bar at the bottom of the object., f 188

#X text 520 1063 v---- inlet;
#X text 517 969 ^---- outlet;
#X text 485 1101 Fig. 4 Object inlet;
#X text 22 444 To edit Pd code \, you must go into edit mode \, via
the menu "Edit>Edit Mode". You will notice that the cursor will turn
into a pointing hand \, and the title bar will now say "*edit*" next
to the file's name., f 189;
#X text 23 474 Objects are inserted into the Pd canvas using the "Put"
menu. There in the menu are all the primitive Pd objects available.
These are objects that can only be placed into Pd with this menu. All
other objects that we will use in Pd can be called by typing the name
of the object into a "blank" object box via "Put>Object", f 189;
#X text 357 509 Here is a plain empty object box. It doesn't do anything
until you type the name of the function you want the object to take
on. If you forget the name of an object \, "Help>List of Objects..."
lists all of the objects that come with Pd. You insert the empty object
box by using the "Put" menu \, "Put>Object", f 90;
#X text 360 636 [metro] \, a metronome object \, which sends out a
message a regular interval (example: every 500 ms), f 90;
#X text 357 583 [+] \, an addition object \, which you get from typing
the "+" symbol into an empty object box. This object adds two numbers
together., f 90;
#X text 23 774 One of the best things about Pd is that every object
has an associated Help file that will explain how an object works.
To access an object's help file \, RIGHT-CLICK on the object and choose
"Help". Unfortunately some of the help files are written with the assumption
that you are well versed in media programming \, so while helpful as
a reminder \, some help files will take some time for you to decipher.
