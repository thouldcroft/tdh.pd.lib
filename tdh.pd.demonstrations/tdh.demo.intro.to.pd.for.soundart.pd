#X text 356 762 The [print] object prints any data you send to it in
the console \, known as the Pd WINDOW. This is the first window that
opens when you open Pd. You can get to it from the menu "Window > Pd
window"., f 90;
#X text 22 1295 Objects receive information at their inlets \, the
small black bars on the top of an object. Some objects have more than
one inlet. The leftmost inlet is (almost) always what we call the "hot"
inlet. Data to this inlet sets parameters and causes output. Other
inlets are cold inlets \, which don't cause output \, but do set parameters.

#X text 24 242 Pd As a Programming Language;
#X text 24 303 To program in Pd you connect boxes \, known as objects
\, together to form an algorithm. Some objects are plain objects that
don't do much other than process information \, while other objects
allow you to click on them and interact with them (which makes Pd much
more accessible than a text based programming language)., f 192;

#X text 21 64 Introduction, f 24;
#X text 22 1154 Object Communication;
#X text 26 1194 Objects communicate by sending messages to each other.
To send a message \, an object must output a message from its outlet
\, which is the small black bar at the bottom of the object., f 188
;
#X text 486 1257 Fig. 3 Object outlet;
#X text 520 1333 v---- inlet;
#X text 517 1239 ^---- outlet;
#X text 485 1371 Fig. 4 Object inlet;
#X text 22 484 To edit Pd code \, you must go into edit mode \, via
the menu "Edit>Edit Mode". You will notice that the cursor will turn
into a pointing hand \, and the title bar will now say "*edit*" next
to the file's name., f 189;
#X text 357 589 Here is a plain empty object box. It doesn't do anything
until you type the name of the function you want the object to take
on. If you forget the name of an object \, "Help>List of Objects..."
lists all of the objects that come with Pd. You insert the empty object
box by using the "Put" menu \, "Put>Object", f 90;
#X text 360 716 [metro] \, a metronome object \, which sends out a
message a regular interval (example: every 500 ms), f 90;
#X text 357 663 [+] \, an addition object \, which you get from typing
the "+" symbol into an empty object box. This object adds two numbers
together., f 90;
#X text 23 854 One of the best things about Pd is that every object
has an associated Help file that will explain how an object works.
To access an object's help file \, RIGHT-CLICK on the object and choose
"Help". NOTE that if you accidentally click outside the object \, you
will get the List of Objects page \, not the object's help page. Unfortunately
some of the help files are written with the assumption that you are
well versed in media programming \, so while helpful as a reminder
\, some help files will take some time for you to decipher., f 189
;
#X text 485 1571 Fig. 5 Object inlet;
#X text 23 514 Objects are inserted into the Pd canvas using the "Put"
menu. There in the menu are all the primitive Pd objects available.
These are objects that can only be placed into Pd with this menu. All
other objects that we will use in Pd can be called by typing the name
of the object into a "blank" object box via "Put>Object". All objects
referred to by text will be surrounded by brackets ([]) to indicate
that we are discussing an object (example: [print] refers to an object
box with "print" typed into it)., f 189;
#X text 457 1696 Fig. 6 Try it yourself. Unlock the patch and connect
a patch cord from the [+] object to the [print] object., f 37;
#X text 29 1794 Comments;
#X text 26 1822 You will see that one of the primitives in the "Put"
menu is called "comment". All of this text (and all text in this patch)
was created using the comment object. Comments don't do anything besides
display text \, but they are helpful for reminding you of code you
wrote \, or to tell an outside user what is happening. Or for typing
text to explain Pd from within a Pd patch! Inserting a [comment] object
will put a small line of text with the word "comment" into your patch
\, highlighted in blue. Click on the word to edit this text and you
can type any character you like (emojis unfortuately are currently
unsupported). Comments can be moved around the patch by clicking,
f 192;
#X text 22 1394 To connect two objects \, go into edit mode \, place
the mouse over an outlet until the cursor turns into a circle. Click
and drag and what is known as a PATCH CABLE will follow the mouse.
Hold down the mouse button until you are over the inlet of another
object \, and release the mouse button. The outlet is now connected
to the inlet. The connecting cables are called patch cables because
in analog studios \, devices would be "patched" together using cables
called patch cables. This why a Pd file is actually called a PATCH
\, and where we edit code has traditionally been called the PATCHER
in the software predecessors for Pd (and Max) \, though Pd often refers
to this editing as the CANVAS. It is also common to refer to edit mode
as an UNLOCKED PATCHER \, and when not in edit mode \, the patcher
is LOCKED., f 189;
#X text 26 918 Try out inserting objects for yourself below. Unlock
the patch (Edit>Edit Mode). Use "Put>Object" to place an empty object
box in the white space below \, know as the CANVAS or (historically)
the PATCHER (see below). You will see that the empty object box follows
the mouse around. Click to place the object below. You will then see
a flashing cursor inside the box. Type the name of one of the object
above \, and then click outside the object. You will see that the object
has now taken on the form of the object whose name you typed in \,
with the correct number of inlets and outlets (see below) that are
associated with that object., f 187;

#X text 244 2004 Message;
#X text 244 2029 You type a message \, either text or number \, into
this box \, and clicking on the box sends the message. Note how it
looks different than a regular object. It still has inlets and outlets
though. Any text that references a message object either with typed
in text or with text you should type into the message object will be
written like this "[55(". With the patcher LOCKED \, click on the message
objects below. You will see the border of the objects darken \, indicating
that you have clicked on them. Then look at the Pd window (Window>Pd
Window) \, where you will see the messages printed., f 119;

numbers between XXXXXX and XXXXXXX \, so you will see the number box

that goes beyond the display and results in "+" or "-" \, can cannot
click and drag to change the number like you can with numbers within

#X text 244 2193 The [number] box is another object to send or display
numbers. You can enter numbers by clicking and dragging in the [number]
box \, or you can click once inside the box and type a number \, hitting
RETURN when you are done. The number object can display both integer
numbers (whole numbers) and floating-point numbers (decimal numbers).
To get a floating point value in the number box \, hold shift while
dragging up or down \, or type the decimal point in when entering the
number from the keyboard. Unlike other computer programming languages
(including MAX) \, Pd only deals with floating-point numbers. So even
when you type "15" \, Pd will interpret this as "15.0". There are limits
to the range of numbers Pd can handle \, approximately in the range
of -xxxxxx.0 to xxxxxx.0. The number box can only display 5 characters
\, after that it loses its accuracy. If you are interested in exploring
the limits of the number box \, double-click the box to the right and
a new window will open demonstrating some of these limits., f 119
;
#X text 23 1948 Some objects are meant for you to manipulate. These
are called USER INTERFACE (UI) objects. They are a part of the GRAPHICAL
USER INTERFACE \, or GUI. GUI objects can be created by typing their
name into an empty object or by using the "Put" menu. In edit mode
\, GUI objects can be edited \, but GUI objects can only be controlled
by the user when you are out of edit mode. When you are not in edit
mode \, we say the patch is LOCKED. Below are a couple of objects we
will see in the next lesson:, f 192;
#X text 31 1924 User Interface Objects;
#X text 244 2404 Bang;
#X text 244 2429 "bang" is a unique message that is used in Pd and
Max. Many objects respond to the message "bang" \, other objects output
the message "bang". You can think of it generally as a message that
tells an object "hey \, do what you do" and the object does it., f
119;
#X text 245 2479 The "bang" message can be issued by the [bang] user
interface object. It is useful for: issuing the "bang" message to another
object \, showing when a "bang" message is sent (it flashes when it
receives a "bang" \, or often I will use it as a generic button that
a user can click on. Below are some other uses for the object \, and
also shows objects that output "bang"., f 119;

#X text 69 3602 Conclusion;
#X text 68 3622 Now you know the basics of Pure Data \, and will be
able to interact with custom patches that demonstrate elements of sound
and acoustics. This only scratches the surface of Pd \, and with Pd
you can even extend the environment by downloading new libraries from
other programmers on the internet. You can do things such as communicate
with robotics via an Arduino board \, create interactive visuals \,
make cool music or make experimental sound art. Pd is your sandbox.

#X text 24 272 Pd as a Programming Language Pd is unlike most computer
languages \, in that it isn't purely text based. However \, Pd contains
almost all of the elements one would look for in a programming language
\, such as data storage structures \, variable \, and the ability to
develop algorithms., f 192;
#X text 22 95 Pure Data is actually a COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
for media. It developed out of work at IRCAM in Paris by Miller Puckette
\, where it was called MAX. In the 1990's MAX was developed into a
commercial product \, so Miller Puckette decided to split off and continue
to develop MAX as a free \, open source language called PURE DATA.
It was first developed to control sound parameters of external hardware
sound generators \, but soon developed the ability to control and generate
sounds from within the environment. Pd can even generate visuals \,
play movies \, and create animations. You may be wondering why we are
using a programming language (you also might be slightly intimidated
by that term). First rest easy because Pd isn’t like a typical programming
language. Second \, the reason why we are using it is because Pd allows
you to do things that many sound software platforms don’t let you
do… and the point of sound art is to do things with sound that reach
down to the core of what sound is. FINALLY \, Pd can be run on a computer
\, on a phone \, a tablet \, or even a RaspberriPi \, which makes it
really convenient when developing a sound installation - say you want
sounds played into a public space and you don’t want to leave your
computer out and running \, you can run your sound program off an old
phone or a RPi., f 192;
